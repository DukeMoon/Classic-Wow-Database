<div class="text"><h1>[Macro] Completing repeatable quests <small><a href="http://www.aowow.org/?forums&topic=2">(topic)</a></small></h1></div><div id="repeat"><div class="forums-post-body comment-green">Ok friends, many of us do reapeatable quests for rep/money/tokens.<br>But if we worked hard and got tons of required items, it takes a lot of patience to cycle through clickin on the NPC and quest buttons (complete, accept...x_x)<br><br>So I made my homework on Googling and found some interesting solutions, which I gathered up into one working Macro:<div class="quote">/run SelectGossipActiveQuest(<ins>1</ins>);CompleteQuest();GetQuestReward(<ins>1</ins>)</div><b>How it works:</b><ol><li><div>You right-click on the quest giver</div></li><li><div>spam this macro (here it's 3 times)</div></li><li><div>Ok, back to point 1!</div></li></ol><b>Note:</b> The first underlined number in brackets means what quest is selected in the list (starting from 1);<br>The second one denotes what reward will be taken(1, 2, 3...);<br>So change them if there are more than one quest/reward.<br><br><b>WSG Marks quest:</b><br>There are quests for <a href="http://www.aowow.org/?item=20558" target="_blank">WSG marks</a> that involve repeatedly accepting and completing the quest. I've made a macro for them as well! :P<br>Here it is:<div class="quote">/run qu=GetGossipActiveQuests(); if(qu~="Mark of Honor" and qu~="Talismans of Merit") then SelectGossipActiveQuest(1);CompleteQuest();GetQuestReward(1)  else SelectGossipAvailableQuest(5);AcceptQuest();CloseQuest() end</div><ul><li><div>Just right click the quest giver and spam the macro until quest closes. Then repeat :D</div></li></ul><b>Note:</b> By default it accepts the 5th quest in the list, which is for 60 level.</div></div>
